    <i>How to play Cat Wars</i>
  </h2>
    <p>
      Think you got what it takes to slang cats on the black market in Seattle? You’ll find out when you take a run at glory in Cat Wars!
    </p>

    <p>
      Object: Travel through the city in one week and make $5,000 or more through the illegal cat trading market and you win! Finish with less than $5,000 and you're just a crazy cat lady. Or man.
    </p>
        
    <p>How to get started: Each day, you are allotted five actions to take. Your game starts off in Downtown with $500 bucks in your pocket. You need $5,000 at the end of the week to conquer the cat market and win the game.
    </p>

    <ul id="actions">
        Your actions to choose from each day include:
    </ul>  
      <li id="move1">
        Buying a cat
      </li>
        
      <li id="move2">
          Selling a cat
      </li>
        
      <li id="move3">
          Change your 'hood
      </li>
      <p>
      Changing a neighborhood exhausts your turns for the day which effectively moves you to the next day, so use this option wisely. Cats are assigned different values varying by neighborhood and type of cat. Good luck and happy cat slangin’!
